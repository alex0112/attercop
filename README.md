# Attercop

Attercop is an experimental Elixir-based GraphQL penetration testing and attack surface discovery tool that scans and identifies public GraphQL endpoints.
Inspiration for architecture and use was drawn from other tools such as [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/).

## Features:
- [x] Introspect a GraphQL API and display field information to the end user
- [x] Search through introspection data to identify arguments that can potentially be used in an attack
- [ ] Generate modules allowing for automatic IDOR detection (WIP)
- [ ] Execution of suites of modules, with analysis of the results and a confidence score (WIP)
- [ ] Authentication layer
- [ ] Module generator
- [ ] Interface existing analysis module with module configs
- [ ] Installable executable through package manager

## Building the script
- Clone this repository
- run `mix escript.build`

## Running the script
Once the script is built as a local binary, you can run it by calling it directly:
```
$ ./attercop introspect https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
...
# ./attercop recon https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ 'id'
...
```

## General Usage
